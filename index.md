# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the relaiable friend of a programmer, the rubber duck.

## What is a Rubber Duck?

A Rubber duck is a toy shaped like a duck that can float on water.  All though it's recognizable with it's yellow color, it comes in any colors, themes, and sizes.

## Why is it important to programmers?

When a programmer gets stuck on a code for a hile, whether it's fixing a bug in someone else's or your code has a bug, it helps to say it out loud to figure out the issue.  That's where the rubber duck comes in, you can talk to the rubber duck out loud and, most likely, you can find a solution to the problem.
